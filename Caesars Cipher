/*One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. 
In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.*/


function rot13(str) { // LBH QVQ VG!
 var deciphered = '';

  for (i=0 ; i < str.length; i++){
  var code;
	  code = str.charCodeAt(i);
	    if (code > 64 && code <= 77) {
		    code = code +13;
	    }
	    else if ( code > 77 && code <= 90) {
		    code = code - 13;
	    }
	    deciphered += String.fromCharCode(code);
  }
  return deciphered;
}
